        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            title (``str``):
                Product name, 1-32 characters.

            description (``str``):
                Product description, 1-255 characters

            payload (``str`` | ``bytes``):
                Bot-defined invoice payload, 1-128 bytes. This will not be displayed to the user, use for your internal processes.

            currency (``str``):
                Three-letter ISO 4217 currency code, see `more on currencies <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-currencies>`_. Pass ``XTR`` for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            prices (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.LabeledPrice`):
                Price breakdown, a JSON-serialized list of components (e.g. product price, tax, discount, delivery cost, delivery tax, bonus, etc.). Must contain exactly one item for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            provider_token (``str``, *optional*):

            start_parameter (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique deep-linking parameter. If left empty, **forwarded copies** of the sent message will have a Pay button, allowing multiple users to pay directly from the forwarded message, using the same invoice. If non-empty, forwarded copies of the sent message will have a URL button with a deep link to the bot (instead of a Pay button), with the value used as the start parameter.

            provider_data (``str``, *optional*):
                JSON-serialized data about the invoice, which will be shared with the payment provider. A detailed description of required fields should be provided by the payment provider.

            photo_url (``str``, *optional*):
                URL of the product photo for the invoice. Can be a photo of the goods or a marketing image for a service. People like it better when they see what they are paying for.

            photo_size (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo size in bytes

            photo_width (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo width

            photo_height (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo height

            need_name (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's full name to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            need_phone_number (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's phone number to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            need_email (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's email address to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            need_shipping_address (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if you require the user's shipping address to complete the order. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            send_phone_number_to_provider (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if the user's phone number should be sent to the provider. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            send_email_to_provider (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if the user's email address should be sent to the provider. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            is_flexible (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if the final price depends on the shipping method. Ignored for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

        Returns:
            ``str``: On success, the created invoice link is returned.
